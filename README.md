# lua-osg-livecoding binary package - Cygwin x64

This package is hosted on scene.org and at <https://github.com/cxw42/lol-bin>.

## Running

 1. Install Cygwin, x64.  Make sure to install at least the following
    packages: `lua`, `7-zip`, `libsndfile`, `portaudio`.
    (Note that X11 is not required.)
 1. Unzip this somewhere convenient, preserving directory structure (`7z x`).
 1. Fire up a shell and `cd` into the directory where you unzipped.
 1. `./runme.sh` to launch `livecoding.exe` with the correct settings and
    paths.  Or, to start a shell in which everything is ready, `./runme.sh -i`,
    and then `./livecoding` from the resulting shell.

To change the default size or position of the window, edit `runme.sh` and
change the `OSG_WINDOW` line.

## Running samples

The `samples` directory has a number of samples in it.  To run one:

    ./runme.sh -r samples/texture.lua

(or whatever filename after `-r`).

When you run a sample, the camera manipulator will be off by default.  To
turn it on so you can manually pan/zoom/rotate the view, say `camon`
at the livecoding command line, or specify `-o` when you run `runme.sh`.
